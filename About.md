# Introduction #

The audience for this project is intended to be software developers who are new to developing Google Android Applications, and also for those developers that are searching for a clean and simple SQLiteOpenHelper Database Adapter implementation.

Constructive feedback is appreciated.

I am looking for feedback on improving this database adapter code, my custom AlertDialog.Builder code, etc.

Since this project is meant to help beginning developers, educate developers on a few commonly used techniques, such as database data storage, logging, alert messages, exporting data, etc., my goal is to improve and build on what I have started with, to ensure that the techniques presented here are solid and stable, maximizing performance and efficiency where possible.

Furthermore, beyond educating developers, another goal in this project is to provide useful code that can be reused in other projects to help developers reduce their development time.
