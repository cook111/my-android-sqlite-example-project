This is a simple Google Android Mobile Application with a list activity to demonstrate using a custom SQLiteOpenHelper database adapter, etc.

The audience for this project is intended to be software developers who are new to developing Google Android Applications, and also for those developers that are searching for a clean and simple SQLiteOpenHelper Database Adapter implementation.

I have provided some documentation in the downloads section of this project, to help you get started, including the full downloadable Eclipse Android Project source file in a .ZIP file format, and an executable Android .APK file, built from this project (refer to the description for installation instructions).

The project consists of a simple list activity for demonstrating how to do different things in Android, including:

- A SQLiteOpenHelper database adapter, how to properly open and close it, etc.
The updated source code uses a method that more closely Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) for handling the database objects, and tried to emulate SQL stored procedures.

- A custom alertdialog.builder message box

- Logging messages, warnings, errors, etc.

- How to export SQLite database data

- How to sort data through a custom Preference Activity

- How to clean up objects in onDestroy

- How to make menu icons

- How to add animation to buttons

- How to create User Interfaces

- How to use the string.xml file to populate labels, text, etc.

- How to create a date-select button

- And more.

Have fun, this is meant to be educational, and constructive feedback is appreciated.

Thank you.
